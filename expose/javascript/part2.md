1. line 12 will output the last recorded value of i in the for loop. In this case, i would most likely equal the length of the prices array.
2. Line 13 will print the last recorded value of discountedPrice without error.
3. Line 14 will print the last recorded value of finalPrice without error.
4. The function will return the array discounted containing all the finalPrices pushed in during the loop.
5. Line 12 will return an error, because the variable i was declared out of line 12's scope.
6. Line 13 will return an error, because the variable i was declared out of line 13's scope.
7. Line 14 will return the last recorded value of finalPrice without error.
8. This function will return the array discounted without error.
9. Line 11 will return an error, because the variable i was declared out of line 11's scope.
10. Line 12 will return the value of length, which equals prices.length.
11. This function will return an error at line 8. The discounted array was declared as a const, and it is trying to be altered. This causes an error.

    A. student.name
    B. student["Grad Year"]
    C. student.greeting()
    D. student["Favorite Teacher"].name
    E. student.courseLoad[0]

    A. 5, strings are converted into numbers
    B. 1, strings are converted into numbers
    C. 3, null becomes 0 during addition.
    D. 3, '3' typecasts to 3 and null typecasts to 0 during addition.
    E. 4, true typecasts to 1 and adds itself to 3.
    F. 0, false typecasts to 0 and null typecasts to 0 during addition.
    G. NaN, adding undefined during addition turns the result into Nan.
    H. NaN, subtracting undefined during addition turns the result into Nan.

    A. True, '2' gets typecasted to a number, which then compares with 1.
    B. True, both values get typecasted to the numbers 2 and 12, which results in a numerical comparison.
    C. True, '2' gets typecasted to the number 2, which makes them equal.
    D. False, the two values are not the same type and the comparison outputs false.
    E. False, true gets typecasted to a 1 during comparisons, which is not equal to 2.
    F. True, Boolean(2) equals true.
15. The == checks for equality between two values after they're both type-casted to be the same type. The === does not typecast and also checks if they're the same type.

17. The function will return an array containing the numbers 2, 4, and 6. When the array is passed into the function, each value of the array will be passed through the callback function, which in this case multiplies the input by 2. Therefore, 1,2,3 turns into 2,4,6.
